# Gender-Classification-Model
The aim is to predict the gender of individuals using image data sets. 
A growing number of applications, especially after the increase in social networks and social media, 
are being concerned with automatic gender classification.

# Approach
Our approach in creating a gender classification model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) involves several steps:
Data Importation and Augmentation
1. Model Architecture design 
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
